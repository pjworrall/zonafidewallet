    <h4>Create a Zone</h4>
    <p>In the past any action could be carried out, at any time, in your name. If an impostor obtained enough
        information about you to satisfy
        an organisations criteria they could carry out an action as you. When you use Zonafide no action can be
        carried out,
        at anytime, without you declaring that a Zone exists for the action.</p>
    <p>This is so different to how organisations have you behave today that you need to experience it. Let's create
        our first Zone.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>Activate a Zonafide ID</h4>
    <p>First we need to activate your Zonafide ID. You would have been given a phrase to remember when you first
        created
        it.</p>
    <div>
        <form class="set-credential">
            <input type="text" name="seed" size="80" placeholder="Enter the phrase to activate..."/>
        </form>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div>Your ZID: <strong>{{zid}}</strong></div>
    <br>
    <h2>Protect an Action with a Zone</h2>
    <p>To start to protect an action your first create a zone and invite others to acknowledge you intend to perform
        an action. You do not specify what the action is yet.
        At all times Zonafide ensures only just enough information is used to make your action possible. This stops
        information leakage. You might be used to organisations
        asking you for as much information as possible. That is because the information is of interest to them but
        not necessarily in your interests to reveal it.</p>
    <form class="create-zone">
        <button>Create Zone</button>
    </form>
</div>
<p>A Zone was created (this will be shown as a QR Code): <strong>{{zad}}</strong></p>

<h2>Zone Members</h2>

<p>Provide the address of someone who you would like to acknowledge the action protected by the zone. This makes it much more difficult for
an imposter to carry out an action as you because they would have to compromise that person to. The more members that you have to acknowledge
your zone the harder it would be to compromise you.</p>

<div>
    <form class="set-member">

<h2>Check A Member</h2>

<p>To test the member was added. Provide the member ZID again...</p>

    <div>Yes or No?: <strong>{{ismember}}</strong></div>
