            <h4>Create a Zone</h4>
            <p>Create a Zone to protect an action. You do not specify what the action is yet.
                Zones ensure only just enough information is used to make your action possible. This stops
                information leakage. You might be used to organisations
                asking you for a lot more information. That is because it is in their interests:
                but not necessarily in yours.</p>

                    you can control it.  You will refer to this when carrying out the action with the other party. You will add
                    people to acknowledge the Zone next. You will add the party involved in the action, the description and any
                    reference information once the Zone is acknowledged.</p>
