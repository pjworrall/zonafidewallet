            <h4>Create a ZID</h4>
            <p>A Zone ID (ZID) is something you create and control.
                 Anyone can know your ZID but it is only controllable by you and cannot be used to carry out actions in your name.</p>
            <p>If you already have a ZID unlock it with <i class="fa fa-unlock fa-2x" aria-hidden="true"></i> above.
                Otherwise you can create one below.</p>

                        need to create a new one and use that for your Zones instead. You can abandon any Zones that were associated with the
                        previous ZID. Nobody else can use those Zones: not even you!</p>
