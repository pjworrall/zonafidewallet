                <h4>Create an Address for Zonafide</h4>
                <p>An Address is something you create and control. The Address will have a Key. You can share the Address
                    with other Zonafide users but the Key <strong>must</strong> be kept a secret.</p>

                <p> Don't forget the Key. Write it down offline or keep it safe in a password manager. If you
                    lose it your Address and any Activities created with it will be unusable. You will have to create a new Address
                    and Key.</p>
                <p>If you already have that Key use it to unlock your Address above ( <i class="fa fa-unlock"
