                <h4>Acknowledge Someone's Zone</h4>
                    <p>People are at the heart of how Zones prevent illegitimate actions being carried out in another's name.
                    You do not need to know anything about the action the Zone is protecting. Just acknowledging is enough
                    to prevent unintended actions happening.</p>
