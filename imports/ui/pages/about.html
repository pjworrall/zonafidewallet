            <h5>Keys</h5>
            <p>Zonafide<span class="standardtm">&reg;</span> represents you to others as an <strong>Address</strong>. In
                this version of the App you
                have one Address. You share your Address with others. For example, when someone wants to have you as an
                Acknowledger of their Activities.
                An Address has a corresponding <strong>Key</strong>. Technically this is a <strong>
                    Seed</strong> but to keep it simple it is referred to as a Key in the App. <strong>Keep the Key
                    secure</strong>. You need to provide the
                Key to use the App.

            <h5>Ethereum Node</h5>
            <p>You need access to an Ethereum Node to use this App. You provide that in <strong>Settings</strong> and by
                default it will
                be assigned the Zonafide<span class="standardtm">&reg;</span> test network. You use that network at your
                own risk. You can use your own Ethereum Node if you know how.
                If you use a Node connected to the live Ethereum network you do so at your own risk. We suggest not
                using the Beta App on the live Ethereum network.

            <h5>ETH Credit</h5>
            <p>You will need to credit the Address created in the App with some ETH on the Ethereum network you chose.
                If using the
                default Zonafide<span class="standardtm">&reg;</span> test network share your Address with us by email
                at info@zonafide.net, or on twitter with @Zoneoftrust,
                and we will credit it with a small amount of test ETH.
