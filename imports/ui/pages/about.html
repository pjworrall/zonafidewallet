            <h4>Zonafide: Work together to stop fraud</h4>

            <p>Zonafide Trusted Zones...
            <ul>
                <li>Stops fraudsters acting in your name</li>
                <li>Assures people an activity is legitimate</li>
                <li>Enables friends, family and professionals to help in that assurance</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>We enable people to work together to prevent fraudulent activities taking place in
                their name. A Trusted Zone is a digital notice placed around an Activity
                that friends, family or professionals Acknowledge. </p>

            <p> Recipients of the Trusted Zones are assured that an Activity you want to carry
                out with them is genuine because it is much harder for imposters to compromise
                a group of people. </p>

            <h4>Zone States</h4>
            <p>Activities in Zones have a number of states represented by these symbols:</p>
